Hello! Thank you for downloading Aurora.EXE! She's an original character that, in her universe, is a virtual youtuber that shares an ukagaka of herself to her fans. Currently there is no relationship system, so don't feel afraid you'll make her angry. She'll cheer you on no matter what!

Currently there are no content warnings for Aurora, but future updates will include horror elements, in visuals (able to be toggled off) and text. 

-------------------------------------------

Aurora was created from a template made by Zarla, who you can find in the following places:
