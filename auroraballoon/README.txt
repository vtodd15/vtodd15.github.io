A balloon for Aurora.EXE. Simple and neon, with alternate colors avaliable. Tested only with a single character, so no guarantees on behavior for multiple characters.

Based off z-simple balloon from Zarla, http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html

Font used for the input/send/communicate/teach balloons is Charriot Deluxe, made by Jelloween - https://www.deviantart.com/jelloween/art/Font-CHARRIOT-Deluxe-31326056
